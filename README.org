* Customizable Documentation Repository :Custom:Docs:
This is a resource to allow you to conveniently browse documentation from one central location. This is especially useful for React/Redux as you can query one set of documentations to get information really quickly, instead of wading through outdated tutorials/articles on Google.

* Color Scheme Generator :Color:Schemes:
This application alleges to use color theory to create a customized color pallette. You can cycle through possible color matches as you "lock them in". If you want to start from an image as an inspiration for the page, you can also generate the color palette from it and modify as you want. Exports to hex are free.

* CSS Grid Generator :CSS:Grid:Generator:
This application is particularly nice. CSS grids are fantastic for creating predictable, stable CSS layouts. Laying out your page via a grid can save you a lot of CSS headaches and superfluous code. Grid sections synergize especially well with React components. The only problem with grids is that making anything of any substantial complexity can be quite daunting and realistically, to design a quality CSS grid, one generally first puts pen to paper and translates from there. Work smarter, not harder, use this instead.

* Wireframing :Wireframing:
In my humble opinion, wireframing software is ridiculously complex. Simple is best, and this is the simplest I know of. https://draw.io/

* DB Diagramming
1000x prettier than dbdiagram. https://drawsql.app/

* Git Help
- Here is the definitive git resource; if you find yourself struggling with git, you may want to consider devoting some time to reading this. Just the first 4 chapters will tremendously improve your understanding of git. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
- For quick and dirty answers (i.e. you forgot a command): https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq

* Additional Resources: stock photos, fonts, icons ... :Additional:
Here is Brad Traversy's famous respository of resources. There's so much stuff you can find in here quickly. *Do NOT copy/paste code*, your project will /never/ be stable if you do not understand what you are doing.

* Heroku Pinger :Heroku:Pinger:
This utility is a creation of a friend and fellow aA alum (Revan Fajardo). To keep your Heroku alive and avoid dyno reloading, you can use this to automate pinging of your application; this is especially useful once you start Career Quest. https://github.com/riousenkai/PingHerokuApp
